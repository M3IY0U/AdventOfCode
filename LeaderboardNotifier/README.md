# Leaderboard Notifications for Discord

## This is a small ruby script to track a private leaderboard in Advent of Code.

To use it, you need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed, then just run `ruby leaderboard.rb`, and it should grab all dependencies by itself.\
In order for it to properly function, you need to provide a config like [the one in this folder](config.json), only with your actual values.
